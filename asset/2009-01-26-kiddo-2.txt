#===============================================================

A  boy, he was friends with Yudi. Although in mid '70s there was
no  longer  any sign of feudalism whatsoever, the trail was left
in the custom. The boy belonged to a family of a lower class who
at  the  very  concrete  level,  had to call every boy in Yudi's
family in honorified embellishment.

Yudi was different. He felt peers calling him 'mas' was awkward.
He  didn't  enjoy  the  honorified  position. He didn't like the
sound.  It made him feel older already. But Yudi's father always
placed  the  calling  name  whenever referring to him before the
boy.

Beyond  family,  both  boys  were  peas  in a pod. They shared a
strong sentiment upon abstract things they as children were just
taught  about.  They, in the midst of bird hunting season, spoke
of  zero  and indivisibility of zero, infinity, supernaturalism.
They  also  had the common enemy, Mr Bambang, the sports teacher
who  always  barked  on  them about insensible things. They both
hated  his  guts,  and  it had gone worse as one day the boy was
caught  by  the  teacher  taking a pee in the classroom just for
fun.  It  was  a contest which part was fun only little children
could  understand. But Mr Bambang was a prick that he threatened
the  boy  to tell the thing he did to his mother who happened to
be  a  maid  in Yudi's house. That would have been embarrassing.
The  boy  was  intimidated.  They  boy  thought  he could commit
suicide.

But  Yudi, having been told of the threat, was reacting sullenly
as  in  reply  he  uttered  a joke that death was a thing no one
could tell about, that it wouldn't give him a guarantee that the
boy  would  escape the embarassment. Yudi even said, he could go
first,  shaking hands with death and trying hard to come back to
tell  what  it  would  feel like to be dead. The boy was no less
intimadated  anyhow,  not  until Yudi himself was dead. And Yudi
laughed. And they both laughed. They were mates. They laughed at
the same things.

One  day,  they  were amused of playing with fire. They pick the
woodstick  of  a  palm leaf.  The stick was dry but it was still
too  hard for them to burn so they could make a small torch. So,
out of any adult's consent, the boy suggested Yudi to sneak into
the  kitchen  storage  and grab a tank of kerosene. Yudi did it.
They  sinked  the stick to the kerosene and they were pleased as
the flame grew bigger and the torch took longer to die off. They
played it for minutes before the boy felt he had to pee.

As  the  boy  went  behind a big tree to take a leak, a bursting
sound  was heard from the kitchen. It was an explosion. At first
he  was  pleased to hear it for he as a child was always pleased
by  firecrackers.  But  a  few  seconds later, adults started to
scream and cry. At that moment he knew he was in trouble.

He sneaked behind the door. There he saw adults were surrounding
the  stove  Yudi  had been stooping over. One was Yudi's mother,
crying  and  screaming. Yudi's father once fainted before he got
up again and start to curse everyone, including the boy.

The  boy was scared. He ran away to the woods. He climbed up the
highest  tree  and from far away he could see a truck was coming
near  the  house.  A moment later, adults were holding something
hurriedly  and  recklessly  before putting it on the back of the
truck.  The  boy  knew  it was Yudi. He was scared even more. He
sang  Twinkle  Twinkle Little Stars up on the tree repeatedly. A
wood  gatherer who was passing by said to him that he might fall
and  die.  He  shut  his  mouth. The truck Yudi was laid on were
leaving.

The  boy  came  home.  There he saw no one around. The house was
empty.  Still  scared, he went to bed and tried to sleep, hoping
it  was all just a dream that would go away the time he woke up.
It  was  too  early.  He could not sleep. Again he remembered Mr
Bambang. He thought anything bad happened to Yudi was partly his
fault.  It  was him who suggested to Yudi that they should steal
the  kerosene.  Guilt ate him. He was again suicidal. But he was
not sure if it might work.

He hold his cotton pillow tight trying hard to sleep. It was not
working.  He heard her mother cried. She said Yudi had died. Her
mother  stepped  into  the  room  he laid down. She didn't say a
word.  He was hesitant if his mother knew he had something to do
with  Yudi's  death. But then, he felt a little better. Yudi was
dead.  So  he  might come back and tell him how death felt like.
Finally he slept.

As  he  woke  up the next day, Yudi's body arrived at the house.
Many  mourners were in the yard. Yudi's mother sat in the corner
of the yard, mumbling things no one seemed to understand.

The  boy  asked  his father where Yudi was. The father said that
Yudi  was being cleaned, that soon Yudi will be buried and never
to see him again, and that he should never approached Yudi while
Yudi was still being washed. The boy nodded.

Silently  he  made himself prepared. After some time, he started
to  run  to Yudi. Adults screamed at him but he didn't care. His
father  tried  to  grab him but his father missed. He got to the
corner where Yudi's dead body was being washed by old people. He
bent  down  to  see  Yudi's  face as a cloth was covering Yudi's
upper body.

The  boy saw Yudi keenly. Yudi, dead, his left arm was  swollen.
His  skin  was almost entirely black. His left eye and lower lip
melted.  His  teeth  were white  on  black he almost looked like
grinning  all  the  time. The water that felt down from his body
was  red,  sometimes  yellow. A corpse cleaner who was surprised
of  the  boy's  presence  accidentally  pinched Yudi's left arm.
Yudi's arm was skinned.

They  boy cried hard. He screamed that he didn't want to die. He
said that he would never commit suicide. He said that being dead
is not pleasant. He said that Yudi was a bad friend because Yudi
couldn't tell him what death felt like. Dead people are mute, he
said. His father grabbed him from the back.
